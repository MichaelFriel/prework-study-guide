# Pre-course Study Guide

## Description

This project contains a summary of all of the learnings throughout the precourse.
It was built as a way to recall all of the subjects and achievements throughout the course. Building it was a very positive way of practically applying all of the skills that had been discussed so far. It also addresses the problem of information overload, by creating a directory to go back and review past learnings.
